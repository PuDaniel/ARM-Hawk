The ARM-Hawk project consists of a custom designed radio controlled airplane equiped with a scratch built flight computer running custom software. The goal of the project is to develop a system to greatly enhance the flight characteristics of the airplane, as well as to protect its flight envelope.
This repository includes the following parts of the project:

- [ARM_Hawk.pdf](ARM_Hawk.pdf) This file contains a complete description of the project, including the derivation of a flight model and simulation framework, sensor calibration and state estimation algorithms, and the control laws for lateral stability augmentation and stall protection
- [Air_Data_Sensor_Unit](Air_Data_Sensor_Unit) This directory contains information for building and calibrating the custom developed Air Data Probe
- [Airframe](Airframe) This directory contains some information about the airplane used
- [Electronics](Electronics) This directory contains plans for some electronic circuits (RPM sensor, servo switch)
- [Flight_Computer](Flight_Computer) This directory contains the C++ code for the flight software
- [IMU](IMU) This directory contains information for building and calibrating the custom developed Inertial Measurement Unit, as well as a model of the state estimation algorithm
